<h1>A few tips before you choose to buy a life insurance policy:</h1>

<h2 style="margin:35px;">Choose a Reputable Company</h2>
<p>Choose a company with an established reputation to buy your life insurance policy from. Ask your friends or family members for recommendations, or conduct a search online. You will likely recognize the names that a search will pull up first, and those are good places to start. While a less known company may offer you a cheaper policy, you won't have the peace of mind of having the backing of a reputable insurer.</p>


<h2 style="margin:35px;">Determine Your Needs</h2>
<p>Once you've decided on a carrier for your life insurance policy, you'll need to be careful in determining the benefit amount of the policy.

Your agent will conduct an analysis of your needs to help you choose your amount of benefits.</p>


<h2 style="margin:35px;">Answer Questions Truthfully</h2>
<p>Before giving you a quote on the amount of benefits you've chosen for life insurance, your agent will need to ask you a series of questions that determine your risk category. The questions will give insight into the medical history of your family and your current state of health, in addition to lifestyle habits or behaviors that might affect your level of risk. Smoking, for example, changes your risk category, as does engaging in a dangerous hobby, such as skydiving.</p>
