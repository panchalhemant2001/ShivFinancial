<h1>Why do you need Health and Dental Benefit Insurance?</h1>
<p>Many routine health care expenses in Canada such as dental services, prescription drugs, prescription eyewear, and registered specialists and therapists are not covered by your Government Health Insurance Plan. If you're without an employee group plan, these expenses can come out of your pocket. And should an accident or serious illness occur, additional medical expenses might be difficult to pay. Individual Health Care Insurance can help to cover these costs, and many more. Like any other insurance plans, Individual Health Care Insurance gives you peace of mind, provides a safety net for potential financial losses as well as makes easier the burden of day to day medical and dental expenses.</p>


<p>Visiting or immigrating to Canada? Whether you are planning to visit Canada as a tourist, immigrate to Canada, or have family or friends coming for a trip make sure you have covered yourself and people accompanying you with visitor's to Canada travel Insurance. Many visitors do not take out visitors travel insurance believing "it won't happen to me". But it can and does happen to many visitors across the world. If you cannot afford travel insurance, you cannot afford to travel.</p>


<p>Travel health insurance for visitors to Canada helps protect visitors and tourists from unexpected costs due to sudden illness, accidents, or health and medical emergencies while travelling in Canada. It is very important to know that Canada's well known health care system does not offer free medical care for visitors or tourists. In case of any emergencies or due to sudden illness paying for emergency health care from our own pockets can be a financial burden as medical services in Canada are very costly. In order to ease your financial stress in case of medical emergency it is always a wise decision to protect one or your friends or family members visiting Canada by purchasing insurance when travelling to Canada.</p>
