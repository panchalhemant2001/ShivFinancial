<h2 style="margin:35px;">What is Permanent Life Insurance?</h2>
<p>Permanent life insurance is a contract between the policy owner and the insurer where the insurer agrees to pay a lump sum of money at the time of the insured`s death. In return, the policy owner agrees to pay a stipulated amount called a premium at regular intervals or in lump sums. In other words, with most insurance policies, life insurance is a contract where a benefit is paid to the designated beneficiary if an insured event occurs which is covered by the policy.</p>

<h1>Key Characteristics of Permanent Insurance</h1>

<p>A key characteristic of permanent insurance is known as cash value or cash-surrender value. In fact, permanent insurance is often referred to as cash-value insurance because these types of policies can build cash value over time, as well as provide a death benefit to your beneficiaries.</p>

<p>Cash values, which accumulate on a tax-deferred basis, can be used in the future for any purpose similar to assets in most retirement and tuition savings plans. In some permanent life insurance policies, you can borrow cash value for a down payment on a home, to help pay for your children's education or to provide income for your retirement. You may also choose to leave it in the policy and allow accumulative growth. When you borrow money from a permanent insurance policy, you are using the policy's cash value as collateral and the borrowing rates tend to be relatively low. Unlike loans from most financial institutions, a permanent insurance loan is not dependent on credit checks or other restrictions. However, the insured must repay any loan with interest or his/her beneficiaries will receive a reduced death benefit and cash-surrender value.</p> 

<p>If you stop paying the premiums, some policies will allow for you to use the accumulated cash value to continue your current insurance protection for a specific time or to provide a lessened amount of death benefit protection. If you decide to stop paying premiums and surrender your policy, the guaranteed policy values will be yours.</p> 

<p>Cash value is accumulated over the time, thus if you surrender your policy early, there may be little or no cash value.</p> 




<h2 style="margin:35px;">Limited pay permanent life insurance</h2>

<p>An additional form of permanent life insurance is limited pay life insurance where all the premiums are paid over a set period after which no additional premiums are required to keep the policy in force. Common limited pay periods include 10-year,15-year, 20-year  and paid-up to age 65.
Some insurers offer a guaranteed cash value at specific ages.</p>


<p>
<strong>Whole Life Insurance Plan</strong>provides  protection for the entire life of the insured person. There are various options to pay premium for these plans. You can choose to pay for life or you can choose to pay in 10, 15, 20 years or till age 65, depending up on the age of the person. The benefit it will pay is locked in for the rest of the life. No more premiums payments are required to keep the life insurance in force and this is a <strong>guarantee in writing.</strong> 
</p>

<p>
There is <strong>guaranteed Cash Value</strong> in the paid-up plans. You can withdraw the cash value and surrender the policy. Many people call it <strong>LIFE  INSURANCE  WITH  MONEY  BACK OPTION.</strong>  If you need a protection for 25 years, surrender the policy after 25 years and get the cash value.
</p>

<p>
Don't surrender the policy if you want to use the cash value and keep the insurance too. You can borrow from the cash value. Certain portion of the cash value can be borrowed by you while you are still alive to supplement your retirement income or to take care of your other financial needs like to pay off your mortgage, other debts or to plan a vacation. Your beneficiary will get the death benefit tax free which is reduced by the amount you borrowed and the interest on it. You use your money while you are alive to maintain your life style and your beneficiaries will get the balance money after your death to take care of your final expenses and rest in legacy.
