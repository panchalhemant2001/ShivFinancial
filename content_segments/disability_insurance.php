<h1>Disability Insurance </h1>
<p>Disability insurance is an insurance contract wherein an insurer undertakes the responsibility to pay money, usually a proportion of the insured's most recent income, or another agreed upon benefit, in the event that the insured becomes disabled and is unable to engage in his/her occupational functions or other daily activities as a result of bodily injury, disease or mental disorder.</p>

<h1>Total Disability</h1>

<p>The definition of “total disability” is different depending on the occupational risk class of the insured.</p>
<p>The own occupation definition of “total disability” is used for those placed in the lower risk class. If the insured person suffers an inability that prevents him or her from performing the duties of his or her own occupation, that person will be considered disabled even if he or she can work in other occupational fields.
The definition of “total disability” in higher risk occupations is a disability that prevents the insured from working in any occupation for which he or she is suited by education, training or experience. Essentially, he or she is unable to work; period.</p> 
<p>Some policies will use the "own occupation" definition for the first two years, but will continue to pay benefits only if you qualify under the "any occupation" definition after that time.</p>

Long term disability plans do not pay the benefits for the life of a person with a disability. The longest period of coverage extends to age of 65.

<p>Disability Insurance is often called Income Protection Plan or Replacement of Income Plan. If you become disabled, your ability to earn income may be compromised, and your ability to pay bills or save for retirement may decline. Your earning potential is a far more valuable asset than your automobile or your home. Accidents and sicknesses do happen in life.  Disability insurance provides you with an income when you are unable to perform your regular occupation due to any injury or sickness.</p>
<p>Most people recognize the need for life insurance, but many do not understand the need for disability insurance. The fact is, when you are disabled because of an illness or injury, your income stops– but your bills don’t. Do you know that 1 in 3 people, on average, will be disabled for 90 days or more at least once before they reach age 65?</p> 
<p>Benefits are paid monthly after a certain waiting period has passed. (There are plans with zero waiting period too). The benefit is paid for the period of time you are disabled up to the maximum amount of time allowed in the policy contract. It could be either 2 years or 5 years or even longer like till age 70. Benefits are usually a percentage of your income. You can have benefits based on your Gross Business Revenue or Net Earned Income.Sometimes a disability affects your ability to work part of the time. That's when Partial Disabilitycan help by paying the benefit amount.</p>
 
<p>Waiver of premium: While you are disabled and benefits are being paid, you are not required to pay premiums and your coverage will continue subject to some conditions.
Your eligibility for disability insurance and the cost of your premiums depend upon various factors such as your health condition, your earnings, your occupation and the type of coverage you aspire to purchase. You can add the rider of Return of Premium. You will get back the amount of premium paid over a period of time if you meet certain conditions.</p>
