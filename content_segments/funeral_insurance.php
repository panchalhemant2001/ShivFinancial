<h1>Funeral Insurance</h1>

<p>The most important benefit of funeral insurance is financial security for your family. According to the 2009 General Price List Survey by the National Funeral Directors Association, the average cost of a traditional funeral is over $7,700, not including cemetery costs. A traditional funeral can easily cost $10,000 or more when you add in cemetery charges. Covering funeral costs is a heavy financial burden for most people, especially if it comes unexpectedly and at a stressful time. Having a funeral insurance policy in place protects your family against this financial hardship and avoids the added stress of paying your final expenses while dealing with their loss.</p>
<p>Most of us don't like to think about our own or for any loved one’s funeral, but no matter how much we ignore the inevitable, the truth is that when the time comes someone will be responsible for those expenses. The question is will it be our grieving loved ones like family members or friends who would pay the bill or would you plan ahead and take out funeral insurance to cover those costs so they'll have one less concern to worry about.</p>
<p>Cost varies with gender, age, smoking status, medical history and the amount of coverage you choose. There are many <strong>guaranteed to issue non-medical plans </strong>available with some conditions attached.</p>
<p>If I were to pass away suddenly, would my family be prepared to take care of the financial obligations?</p>
