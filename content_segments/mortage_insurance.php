<h1>What is a Mortgage Life Insurance?</h1>

Mortgage life insurance (or mortgage protection insurance) is a policy that is used to pay off your mortgage in the event that you die if your family cannot continue your mortgage payments. When purchasing a first home or a new home, most banks will offer mortgage insurance before they will approve the mortgage loan from the financial institution. Many people are therefore unaware that you can purchase mortgage insurance from a bank or from a private insurance company. You are allowed to refuse mortgage insurance provided by the bank when offered and will therefore fill out several waivers and forms to verify your decision to decline said insurance.  

<h1>Is Mortgage Life Insurance Worth the Cost?</h1>

As with all types of insurance, there are always pros and cons to the different policies available. It is important to meet with an advisor and determine your personal situation when choosing the right policy for you. 

<h1>Advantages of Mortgage Life Insurance</h1>

Ensuring the financial stability of your family and providing them with peace of mind is a main goal with mortgage life insurance. This also gives you peace of mind that your loan will be fully repaid and your family will not have to struggle to continue your mortgage payments during this hard time. 

<p>An additional benefit of mortgage life insurance is that there is minimal underwriting and typically universal coverage. Many financial institutions that provide basic mortgage insurance (not mortgage life insurance) practice post-claim underwriting. In the event that the insured dies and a claim is made, this is when the underwriting will be completed and determined whether or not the person was eligible for the insurance. At the inception of your mortgage life insurance policy you usually do not have to provide any medical information. This is a beneficiary life insurance policy for homeowners with serious pre-existing medical conditions that would eliminate them from normal life insurance policies.</p> 
<p>Mortgage insurance is designed to cover your mortgage if you die during the term. These policies are generally on the cheaper side as these have decreasing death benefit over time. This means that the benefit decreases in accordance with your mortgage loan. There is really no difference between a term life insurance policy and a mortgage insurance policy. Mortgage insurance is a term life policy, simply one that is chosen to coincide with your mortgage. You can buy an individually owned term life insurance to coincide with the amortization period of your mortgage and the mortgage balance. This means that you don’t have to buy something that is called mortgage insurance to cover your mortgage. For example, if you have a 25-year mortgage you can purchase a 25-year term mortgage insurance policy that covers the amount owed on your mortgage, ensuring that family left behind will be able to pay off your home and continue to live there.<strong>MONEY BACK OPTION is available too. You will get back the premium paid by you if the amortization period is over and the mortgage is paid off.</p></strong>
