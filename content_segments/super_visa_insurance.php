<h1>Super Visa Insurace</h1>

<p>Parents and grandparents of Canadian citizens and permanent residents have a new option for visiting Canada. As of December 1, 2011, you may be eligible to apply for the Parent and Grandparent Super Visa - which is valid for up to 10 years and allows an applicant to remain in Canada for up to 24 months at a time without the need for renewal of their status.</p>
<p>The Super Visa program is a path for applicants to gain long-term visitor status in Canada. Under normal circumstances, visitors are admitted to Canada for only six month stays.
The Super Visa provides an alternative. It is "super" because it allows parents/grandparents of Canadian Citizens or Permanent Residents to stay in Canada for up to 2 years at a time without the need to renew. When the time comes, they may renew their visa for up to 10 years, with multiple entries allowed during the entire time period.</p>
<p>Citizenship and Immigration Canada has committed to minimizing processing times for this visa. Their stated goal is to issue a decision within 8 weeks of receiving an application. Those who apply have a strong chance of success, as the program has had an 83% application approval rate.</p>

<h1>Eligibility for applying under super visa category:</h1>
<p>To apply for the Parent and Grandparent Super Visa, you must:
•	be the parent or grandparent of a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident of Canada;
•	be found admissible to Canada; and
•	Meet certain other conditions.</p>
<h1>More Information</h1>
<p>Visa officers consider several factors before deciding if a person is admissible. The person must be a genuine visitor to Canada who will leave by choice at the end of the visit. Among the things that could be considered are:</p>
<p>• the person's ties to the home country;</p>
<p>• the purpose of the visit;</p>
<p>• the person's family and financial situation;</p>
<p>• the overall economic and political stability of the home country; and</p>
<p>• An invitation from a Canadian host.</p>
<p>In addition to being found admissible to Canada, the parent/grandparent must also:</p>
<p>- provide a written commitment of financial support from their child or grandchild in Canada who meets a minimum income threshold,</p>
<p>- prove that they have bought Canadian medical insurance for at least one year to cover the period of time that they will be in Canada, and</p>
<p>- Complete an Immigration Medical Examination (IME).</p>
<p>According to the above quote from the government's website, proof of Canadian medical insurance is required. While this may change in the future to a list of approved international carriers, the guidance so far is for visitors to purchase visitors insurance from a Canadian company. Why the restriction? Canadian travel insurance companies are governed by the regulations in Canada, and the government probably feels safer that any claims will be paid for by a company they can regulate. The government doesn't want to be the one to have to pay any claims, or sue a company that doesn't pay out a claim. Hospital costs for visitors to Canada can amount to over $3,000 per day, and air ambulance charges to return you home could very easily be in the tens of thousands of dollars. We recommend $100,000 of medical insurance coverage if peace of mind is what you are after, and a higher amount if you are visiting from farther away, or more elderly. Any policy less than $50,000 will be subjecting the family to unnecessary financial burden.</p>

On December 1st, 2011, the conservative government had finally come with an impressive plan of a new type of visa called the “Super Visa “for parents and grandparents of immigrants and Canadian citizens. This plan was initiated with a motive of clearing the vast backlog of about 165,000 parents and grandparents who are trying to join family in Canada. Parents and grandparents aspiring to visit their loved ones in Canada after applying are granted a 10 years visa which will have to be renewed after a period of 2 years. The main concern of the government is that the applicants wanting to apply for Super Visa is that they or their children who are sponsoring them will have to purchase a private Canadian health insurance, a basic plan that covers each parent up to $ 100,000 during their stay in Canada. Individuals sponsoring their parent or grandparent will have to show they can support their visiting relatives. </p>
<p>Immigration Minister Jason Kenney says that won't be a problem — people who have applied for permanent residency will definitely be eligible for the visa. The immigration department has also stated that the actual rate of acceptance is going to be very high. The minister has also made it clear that the new health insurance requirement may make it easier for visa officers to say "yes." So with the Super Visa effective from today i.e. December 1st, 2011 is a golden opportunity to all the immigrants and Canadian citizens to reunite with their loved ones.</p>
