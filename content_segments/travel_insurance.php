<h1>Travel Insurance</h1>
	
<h1>Newcomers to Canada should get emergency travel health insurance:</h1>
<p>If you are immigrating to Canada, or are a new immigrant, you will find that most provinces have a waiting period before you are eligible for public health insurance. The length of time you have to wait will vary by province; however, no matter how long or short this waiting period all newcomers to Canada should consider getting emergency medical health insurance coverage. It will provide coverage at a time when you have no coverage.</p>

<h1>Travel Insurance for Canadians travelling abroad:</h1>
 
<p>Canadians are travelling overseas in ever-increasing numbers. Whatever your age or destination, properly preparing before you leave and staying in good health while travelling can help you to have a happy and enjoyable  trip. When you travel abroad, you leave behind Canada's support systems, emergency service capabilities and medical facilities.</p>

<p>Make sure it covers all medical expenses for injury or illness, as well as theft of valuables, damage to baggage, and cancellations or interruptions to flight plans. Fully disclose any pre-existing medical conditions in writing. It will save you worry and possible financial hardship. Medical costs overseas can be in the tens of thousands of dollars and many families have been burdened financially in paying these costs when things go wrong.</p>


<p>Compare insurance policies and make sure the cover you choose suits your needs and is valid for the whole time you'll be away. Always read the product disclosure statement carefully and make sure that you understand exactly what your travel insurance covers.</p>


<p>You may be able to obtain travel insurance for yourself and your immediate family or travelling partner under the one policy. However, cover varies from policy to policy so check the fine print.

<h1>For international students in Canada</h1>
<h1>Travel health insurance for international students studying in Canada</h1>
<p><strong>Citizenship and Immigration Canada </strong>Recommends that all international students studying in Canada purchase health coverage when they arrive in the country as foreign students may not be eligible for provincial health care plans. A medical emergency or sudden illness while studying in Canada could ruin your school year.</p> 
<p> In order to concentrate on your studies & to achieve your career goals you need to be healthy. Remember a healthy body in a healthy mind .While as a student you do not expect to sit in one place. You need to move around for work, college, tourist places for outings & enjoyment. Students who study abroad are particularly vulnerable because under normal circumstances, they do not have easy access to funding when in a foreign country; and worse, they do not have the support system that a family or friend can provide in their own countries. With more educational opportunities being offered to people in all parts of the world, it is not unthinkable that the frequency of accidents and sickness would increase in proportion to the number of students.</p> 
<p>Student travel insurance has many types of coverage, the most popular of which are those that include payment of medical expenses from hospitalization and accidental death. Other non-life threatening coverage can also prove useful especially when the incident happens while en route to a particular country. This includes payment for a return trip and legal assistance, to name a few. In any case, an insurance coverage helps pay for any loss incurred if and when any untoward event occurs. A travel safety net ensures that rebuilding one's life after a fall wouldn't be a painful struggle.</p> 
<p>As an international student, you may not be eligible for any government coverage and the costs of medical and dental treatment, for people without Canadian health insurance plans, are expensive. While attending a Canadian academic institution, the last thing on your mind should be the high price of medical services, so be sure to add Travel Student Medical Insurance to your list of school supplies.</p>


<h1>Travel Insurance </h1>
<p>Provincial medical plans do not typically apply to expensive medical emergency costs outside of Canada. These costs are generally financially overwhelming for citizens. For millions of Canadians, comprehensive emergency travel coverage has become an essential part of their holiday plans. A travel insurance plan provides assurance that any unexpected medical emergency costs are covered so you can travel worry free.</p>
<p>Even while travelling outside your province of residence within Canada, some medical and paramedical expenses may only be partially covered by your provincial health insurance program.</p>  
<h1>Additional Coverage Options</h1>
<p>In addition to emergency hospital and medical coverage, travel insurance can offer the choice of Flight Accident Coverage, Trip Cancellation and/or Trip Interruption and Baggage Insurance. It can also be purchased as a Multi-trip annual plan or Single Trip plan. By purchasing an All-Inclusive Package one can take advantage of combined discounted rates.</p> 

<h1>Baggage Insurance</h1>
<p>Your baggage and personal belongings can be damaged, stolen or lost anytime, anywhere in the world. Baggage insurance is important as airlines only provide limited protection for your checked baggage and do not cover your carry-on items. Cruise lines and hotels offer little or no coverage.</p>  

<h1>Trip Cancellation & Interruption</h1>
Provides coverage if your trip is cancelled, interrupted or delayed for a specific reason listed in the policy, such as an unexpected event or an injury to you, a family member, or travelling companion.

<h1>Single Trip Insurance</h1>
Single Trip Insurance can provide security to you and your family while you are engaged in your travelling adventures. These programs provide coverage for unforeseen emergency medical expenses while you are out of your province of residence. Out of province health care costs can be financially burdening as hospitals can charge thousands of dollars daily. Since your resident province may provide partial or no coverage for these charges, you and your family would be responsible for the high costs.

<h1>Multi-Trip Insurance</h1>
<p>This coverage plan allows for the insured to make as many trips during a one-year period without having to buy insurance every time he/she travels outside your home province. This removes the concern of having to purchase coverage for last minute business trips or a surprise weekend getaway.
All-inclusive Package </p>
<p>This plan combines emergency hospital and medical insurance for Canadians as well as trip cancellation and interruption coverage. Since these plans are purchased in combination, you get savings on great coverage.
This plan also provides coverage for delayed baggage, cancellation by the tour operator (for any reason other than default), accidental death & dismemberment, flight accident, and lost or damaged baggage and personal effects. Default of travel supplier can also be covered, subject to some exclusion.</p>

<h1>Other Types of Travel Insurance</h1>

<h1>Visitor to Canada Insurance</h1>
<p>Visitor to Canada Insurance can provide peace of mind that coverage will be provided to one’s family members or friend’s vacation to Canada from an outside country for any unforeseen medical emergency expenses during their visit.</p> 
<p>Health care costs in Canada are very expensive. Without emergency hospital and medical insurance, visitors to Canada would be responsible for these high costs, which can create a significant financial burden.</p> 
  
<h1>Student Medical Insurance</h1>
<p>Some insurance companies recognize the complex needs of International and Canadian student studying abroad. As a result, some of the most comprehensive Student Medical Insurance programs are offered. Insurance plans that available for both International and Canadian students offer the option for the student to purchase coverage for accompanying or extended family members, under a single policy. Some plans provide additional benefits including tutorial services, maternity benefit, annual physician visit, accidental death and dismemberment and much more.</p> 

<p>Travel can be an enriching and unforgettable experience. However, without proper travel insurance, a dream holiday could lead to financial ruin or even worse. Out-of-pocket costs for relatively minor emergencies can put a damper on the vacation, sometimes costing hundreds of dollar. A medical emergency can pose a serious threat to the overall financial well-being. A more severe emergency could affect long-term plans for education or retirement. There have even been instances where families have been forced to rely on their superannuation funds or in some cases sell their homes in order to raise the money to bring their loved ones home - all because they failed to purchase travel insurance. <strong>Travel insurance protects the assets and the net worth of a person.</strong></p> 
<p>Provincial health insurance plans will usually pay for a small portion of out-of-province medical costs, but will fall far short of the full cost. Employer plans or credit cards may offer travel insurance coverage, but it’s wise to compare benefits.</p> 
<p>Travel insurance is not a one solution that fits to everyone. <strong>Premium depends on the age, trip length and health status.</strong> You can get good rates if you are healthy. The longer you’re away the bigger the risks and higher the premium. A casual traveler and a frequent traveler need different plans.
It is advised to read and understand the policy/plan details of the insurance company regarding the list of benefits, eligibility, limitations, exclusions and other terms & conditions. It is important to understand if the pre-existing condition, if any, is covered or not and what are the fine prints, if it is covered, so that you are aware if the claim will be paid or not with respect to the emergency medical treatment for the pre-existing condition or anything related to or due to the pre-existing condition.</p> 
<p><strong>Insurance company must be informed as soon as possible of any emergency medical treatment or hospitalization.</strong> They are available 24/7. Failure to do so may result in decreasing your insurance benefits. All original bills and receipts are required to be sent to the insurance company along with the Claim Form to get the reimbursement. Sometimes hospitals and insurance companies tie up for direct billing but it varies by individual case to case.</p>
<p>Should an unfortunate event occur, the last thing you should be worrying about is whether you’ll have enough money to deal with such an emergency.
Policy is quickly created and confirmation is sent through email to the clients before they take off or leave the home province.</p>
 
<h1>Medical Insurance for Visitors / New Immigrants to Canada</h1>
<p> Couple of hundred dollars paid for the medical insurance can save you from a financial catastrophe. Medical insurance protects you from high cost of emergency medical care. A small slip and fall or even a flu could cost you thousands of dollars. Emergency departments in the hospitals charge thousands of dollars per day. Canadian residents who invite relatives or friends to Canada are responsible for their support. Hospitals and medical offices have legal right to collect unpaid bills from the person who sponsored a visitor in Canada. Without sufficient emergency medical insurance, you and your family would be responsible for these high costs, which can create a significant financial burden. Sometimes, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship may require you to purchase and maintain adequate medical insurance arrangements for the duration of your intended stay in Canada.</p>
<p>Medical Insurance is available for following persons (provided they meet other eligibility requirements too specified by the insurance company):</p>

Coverage must be purchased before the departure from the home country or preferably before reaching Canada. Coverage can be purchased after the arrival in Canada too but a “waiting period” will apply for sickness coverage. Any sickness that manifests itself during the waiting period is not covered even if related expenses are incurred after the waiting period. Injury coverage will start right way.</p>
<p>Coverage is available from $10,000 to $300,000 for emergency medical care if a person is hospitalized.

Coverage for <strong>travel time to/from Canada</strong> and for <strong>side trips </strong>is provided by many ins urance companies subject to certain conditions.</p>
<p>Various deductible options are available to lower the premium and to make it more affordable. You may save from 5% to 45% depending upon the amount of deductible and the insurance company. It is important to understand that deductible will be from each and every claim for most of the companies.</p>
