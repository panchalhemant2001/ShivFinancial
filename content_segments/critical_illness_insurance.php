No one plans to get sick, injured or to die unexpectedly and we all have a tendency to think that it won't happen to us.

It is so important to consider your life insurance needs while you are relatively young and healthy, before you have any health scares and while there are still a range of options available to you.

<h1>Do I need critical illness insurance?</h1>

In determining your need for critical illness insurance, you should consider benefits that may already be available to you through other insurance policies, such as life insurance and group health insurance. Some companies provide additional coverage to group members and their dependents for disabilities, critical illnesses and accidental death and/or dismemberment. However, group plans are generalized and therefore might not meet individual needs. You should first consider what is currently covered in your insurance policies and what additional coverage you need to be fully protected. 
 If you have a mortgage, you have a spouse and dependents or any other financial obligations; you should consider critical illness coverage. In the unforeseen event that you develop a critical illness condition or disease, you want to rest assured that your family and you are protected. The loss of income from one spouse or the loss of a sole income flow can create a financial disaster for you and your loved ones. Public and private health insurance plans generally do not cover day-to-day living expenses. 

<h1>How much does it cost?</h1>

<p>Premium costs for critical illness insurance are dependent on many factors such as the insured’s age, pre-existing medical conditions and the amount of coverage including the number of illnesses covered by the policy. Each insurance company will also have their own rates for the various policy contracts. Typically, it is beneficial for the insured to purchase their critical illness insurance as young as possible. Generally, the younger the insured is, the healthier he/she is and therefore these premium costs will be lower and apply throughout the policy term.</p>

<p>My claim was approved. When do I receive payment?
Each insurer has different requirements before the benefit will be paid out to the insured. Typically, policies mandate a 30 day waiting period after the claim is approved for the individual to receive their payment. However, some policies can have a shortened period of 14 days or no waiting period at all. This waiting period was designed to guarantee that the insured has suffered from one of the covered illnesses for a specific period of time without recovery or death. After said time, the lump sum payment will be given to the insured to use how he/she pleases. Once your claim is paid, your critical illness insurance policy ceases.</p>

<h1>What if I never make a claim?</h1>

Some contracts provide an option which in the event that the insured dies within the specific waiting period or he/she dies from a reason not covered by the policy, the premiums paid will be given back to the beneficiary named in the contract policy. Again, specific to each policy, some plans will return a portion of the premiums or all of the premium payments back to the insured at the policy’s maturity so long as no claim has been made. 

<h1>What if I make a full recovery?</h1>

So long as you have exceeding the waiting period specified in your policy without recovery or death, then you are entitled to collect the whole benefit amount even if you make a full recovery later.

<h1>Is disability insurance the same as critical illness insurance?</h1>

No; Disability insurance provides monthly payments to the insured in the event of a disabling feature which prevents the person from performing his/her normal workplace activities. Essentially, it is applicable to a person with a disability that cannot work or perform daily duties. Disability insurance is meant to act as an income replacement as a result. 

<p>Critical illness insurance does not require the insured to provide an income statement, unlike disability insurance, which appeals to those who do not have fulltime employment, are self-employed or stay at home. Distinctively, critical illness is not based on the individual’s inability to perform work.</p>

<p><strong>Critical Illness Insurance</strong> provides a <strong>tax-free lump-sum payment</strong>  if you are diagnosed with and survive a covered critical illness. A critical illness can happen to anyone. There have even been instances where families have been forced to rely on their superannuation funds or in some cases sell their homes in order to raise the money - all because they failed to purchase the critical illness insurance.
People underestimate the need of critical illness insurance. No one plans to get sick, but when something unexpected happens, you can help yourself and your family by being financially prepared. The physical and emotional strain of a critical illness can be severe and when you combine that with the potentially damaging financial impact, the result can be devastating. The payment you receive from the insurance company helps support you financially. <strong>You decide how to spend the money you receive.</strong>  You can use this payment to pay off or reduce your mortgage or other debts.  You may need to modify your home or vehicle to improve your mobility. You can use the benefit you receive to pay for medications and treatment not covered by provincial health plans or to pay for private nursing or out-of-country treatment or use the benefit in other ways that can help you focus on getting well.
<p>Most of the companies provide <strong>coverage up to 25 life threatening illnesses.</strong>
Many companies provide <strong>partial/additional benefit</strong> up to certain amount  <strong>for non life-threatening medical conditions:</strong> Coronary Angioplasty and/or Cancers detected in early stages: Skin Cancer, Breast Cancer or Stage A Prostate Cancer. Once a benefit is paid, the contract continues according to the same terms and conditions.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of plans available for critical illness insurance. They are <strong>Term Plans</strong> and <strong>Permanent Plans</strong> to choose from depending upon your need and affordability. Cost varies with gender, age, smoking status, medical history and the amount of coverage you choose. Various riders are available too to upgrade the plan. One of them is the rider of <strong>Return of Premium</strong> (provided there is no claim). You will get the refund  <strong>on your death</strong> or <strong>on the expiry of your plan</strong> or on completing the specified number of years of your plan. You will <strong>either get the benefit</strong> from the insurance company (if you are diagnosed with and survive a covered critical illness) or <strong>you will get back the premiums paid</strong> to the insurance company.
<strong>It’s a win-win situation for you.</strong></p>
